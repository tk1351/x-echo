# Project Progress

## Current Status

The X-Echo project is in the early development phase, with the focus on establishing the foundation for the backend API. The project structure has been set up, and the database schema has been partially defined. User registration, authentication, and profile management functionality has been implemented. Frontend development has begun with the implementation of a design system and basic layout structure.

- ❌ User profiles and interactions

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**: Need to implement a consistent error handling strategy across the API
2. **Validation**: Need to establish standardized validation patterns for all endpoints
3. **Testing**: Test coverage is currently focused on user registration and authentication and needs expansion
4. **TypeScript Type Errors in Tests**: Vitest mock function type definitions causing TypeScript errors in tests
   - Specific errors include:
     - `Property 'mockResolvedValueOnce' does not exist on type '<T = any>() => Promise<T>'`
     - `Property 'mockRejectedValueOnce' does not exist on type '<T = any>() => Promise<T>'`
     - `Property 'mockReturnValueOnce' does not exist on type '{ (name: RequestHeader): string | undefined; ... }'`
   - Tests run successfully despite these type errors
   - Fixing would require extending Vitest's type definitions

### Resolved Issues
1. **Authentication Controller Response Format**: Fixed response format in `authController.ts` to use `c.status(statusCode); c.json(data);` instead of `c.json(data, statusCode)`
2. **JWT Payload Type Definition**: Corrected `JwtPayload` type to use `Role` enum instead of `string` for the `role` property
3. **Test Code Consistency**: Updated test code to use `Role.USER` enum value instead of `"USER"` string
4. **Unnecessary `else` Clauses**: Removed unnecessary `else` clauses in `authController.ts` to improve code readability and follow early return pattern

### Blockers
1. **None currently**: No critical blockers at this stage

### Risks
1. **Database Schema Evolution**: As features are added, the database schema may need significant changes
2. **Performance Concerns**: Need to monitor query performance as data volume grows
3. **Security Considerations**: Authentication implementation will require careful security review

## Performance Metrics

### API Response Times
- Target: < 200ms for most operations
- Current: Not yet measured

### Test Coverage
- Target: > 80% code coverage
- Current: User registration and authentication functionality has good coverage

### Code Quality
- Using Biome for linting and formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Following established coding standards
- Applying early return pattern to flatten conditional branches
- Removing unnecessary `else` clauses when `if` blocks always return

### Development Process
- Enforcing strict git workflow for all development work
- Requiring branch creation from latest main for all new work
- Creating commit messages at appropriate times during development
- Creating pull request text before completing work
