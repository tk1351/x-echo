# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on implementing the core backend functionality for X-Echo, with an emphasis on user management and authentication. The project is in its early stages, with the basic project structure and database schema established. User registration functionality has been implemented.

## Recent Changes

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized the project structure
   - Set up the PostgreSQL database with Docker
   - Configured Prisma ORM
   - Established the Hono API framework

2. **Database Schema**
   - Defined the User model in Prisma schema
   - Planned additional models for Follow, Tweet, Favorite, and Retweet

3. **API Development**
   - Created the basic API server with Hono
   - Set up the Prisma client for database access
   - Implemented user registration API with validation and error handling
   - Added password hashing with bcrypt
   - Created comprehensive tests for user registration

## Current Tasks

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implementing login functionality
   - Setting up JWT-based authentication
   - Creating protected routes

2. **Documentation**
   - Documenting the database architecture
   - Creating implementation plans for user-related features
   - Establishing coding standards and patterns

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)

1. **Authentication System**
   - âœ… Complete user registration API
   - Implement login functionality
   - Add JWT-based authentication
   - Create protected routes

2. **User Profile Management**
   - Implement user profile retrieval
   - Add profile update functionality
   - Create user search capabilities

3. **Follow Functionality**
   - Implement follow/unfollow API
   - Update follower/following counts
   - Create API for retrieving followers/following lists

### Medium-term (Next 1-2 Months)

1. **Tweet Functionality**
   - Implement tweet creation
   - Add tweet retrieval (single and lists)
   - Create timeline functionality
   - Implement tweet deletion

2. **Interaction Features**
   - Add favorite/unfavorite functionality
   - Implement retweet capabilities
   - Create reply functionality

3. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Expand test coverage
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching strategies


### Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Evaluating JWT vs. session-based authentication
   - Considering refresh token implementation
   - Planning for secure password reset flow

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identifying potential bottlenecks in database queries
   - Planning pagination strategies for list endpoints
   - Considering caching options for frequently accessed data

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Implementing TDD for new features
   - Creating mock repositories for testing services
   - Planning integration tests for API endpoints

### Open Questions

1. **Frontend Strategy**
   - When to begin frontend implementation
   - Which frontend framework to use
   - How to structure the frontend codebase

2. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Containerization strategy for production
   - CI/CD pipeline implementation
   - Monitoring and logging infrastructure

3. **Scaling Concerns**
   - How to handle increasing user load
   - Strategies for database scaling
   - Caching implementation for performance
