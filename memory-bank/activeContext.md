### Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication Strategy**
   - ✅ Implemented JWT-based authentication
   - ✅ Implemented refresh token functionality
   - ✅ Implemented token blacklist for secure logout
   - Planning for secure password reset flow

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identifying potential bottlenecks in database queries
   - Planning pagination strategies for list endpoints
   - Considering caching options for frequently accessed data

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Implementing TDD for new features
   - Creating mock repositories for testing services
   - Planning integration tests for API endpoints

### Open Questions

1. **Frontend Strategy**
   - When to begin frontend implementation
   - Which frontend framework to use
   - How to structure the frontend codebase

2. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Containerization strategy for production
   - CI/CD pipeline implementation
   - Monitoring and logging infrastructure

3. **Scaling Concerns**
   - How to handle increasing user load
   - Strategies for database scaling
   - Caching implementation for performance

### Current Issues

1. **TypeScript Type Errors in Tests**
   - Vitest mock function type definitions causing TypeScript errors in `authController.test.ts`
   - Specific errors include:
     - `Property 'mockResolvedValueOnce' does not exist on type '<T = any>() => Promise<T>'`
     - `Property 'mockRejectedValueOnce' does not exist on type '<T = any>() => Promise<T>'`
     - `Property 'mockReturnValueOnce' does not exist on type '{ (name: RequestHeader): string | undefined; ... }'`
   - Tests run successfully despite these type errors
   - Fixing would require extending Vitest's type definitions

2. **Linting Warnings**
   - Several `noExplicitAny` and `noImplicitAnyLet` warnings in test files
   - `useLiteralKeys` warnings in some test files
   - These warnings do not affect functionality but should be addressed for code quality
