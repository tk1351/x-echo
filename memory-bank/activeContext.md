3. User profile display - Server Components
4. Timeline display - Server Components + interactive elements as Client
5. Tweet posting functionality - Client Components
6. Interaction features (likes, retweets) - Client Components

   - ✅ Implemented accessibility features
   - ✅ Implemented basic layout structure with TDD approach
   - Planning component library based on design system

### Open Questions

1. **Frontend Strategy**

   - ✅ Decided on Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules for styling with SSR compatibility
   - ✅ Chosen SWR for server state and Zustand for client state management
   - ✅ Established testing strategy using Vitest + React Testing Library
   - ✅ Defined frontend project structure following Next.js App Router conventions
   - ✅ Implemented design system with design tokens
   - ✅ Implemented basic layout structure
   - Planning frontend implementation timeline and feature prioritization

2. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Containerization strategy for production
   - CI/CD pipeline implementation
   - Monitoring and logging infrastructure

3. **Scaling Concerns**
   - How to handle increasing user load
   - Strategies for database scaling
   - Caching implementation for performance

### Current Issues

1. **TypeScript Type Errors in Tests**
   - Vitest mock function type definitions causing TypeScript errors in `authController.test.ts`
   - Specific errors include:
     - `Property 'mockResolvedValueOnce' does not exist on type '<T = any>() => Promise<T>'`
     - `Property 'mockRejectedValueOnce' does not exist on type '<T = any>() => Promise<T>'`
     - `Property 'mockReturnValueOnce' does not exist on type '{ (name: RequestHeader): string | undefined; ... }'`
   - Tests run successfully despite these type errors
   - Fixing would require extending Vitest's type definitions

2. **Linting Warnings**
   - Several `noExplicitAny` and `noImplicitAnyLet` warnings in test files
   - `useLiteralKeys` warnings in some test files
   - These warnings do not affect functionality but should be addressed for code quality
