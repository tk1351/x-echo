# Project Progress

## Current Status

The X-Echo project is in the early development phase, with the focus on establishing the foundation for the backend API. The project structure has been set up, and the database schema has been partially defined. User registration functionality has been implemented.

### Project Timeline
- **Project Start**: Initial setup and planning
- **Current Phase**: Backend API development - User management and authentication
- **Next Phase**: User interactions and tweet functionality
- **Future Phases**: Social interactions, frontend development

## What Works

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ Docker setup for PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Prisma ORM configuration
- ✅ Basic Hono API server running

### Database
- ✅ User model defined in Prisma schema
- ✅ Prisma client setup for database access

### API
- ✅ Basic API server running on port 8080
- ✅ Hello world endpoint functioning
- ✅ User registration API implemented
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Input validation with Zod
- ✅ Error handling for registration process

### Testing
- ✅ Testing infrastructure set up with Vitest
- ✅ Unit tests for user registration implemented
- ✅ Test coverage for user service and controller

### Documentation
- ✅ Database architecture documentation
- ✅ User registration implementation plan
- ✅ Coding standards and patterns established

## What's In Progress

### Authentication
- 🔄 User login functionality
- 🔄 JWT token generation and validation
- 🔄 Protected routes middleware

## What's Left to Build

### Authentication
- ❌ Password reset functionality

### User Interactions
- ❌ User profile management
- ❌ Follow/unfollow functionality
- ❌ Follower/following lists

### Tweet Functionality
- ❌ Tweet creation
- ❌ Tweet retrieval (single and lists)
- ❌ Timeline functionality
- ❌ Tweet deletion

### Social Interactions
- ❌ Favorite/unfavorite functionality
- ❌ Retweet capabilities
- ❌ Reply functionality

### Frontend
- ❌ Frontend project setup
- ❌ User interface design
- ❌ Authentication flows
- ❌ Timeline and tweet display
- ❌ User profiles and interactions

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**: Need to implement a consistent error handling strategy across the API
2. **Validation**: Need to establish standardized validation patterns for all endpoints
3. **Testing**: Test coverage is currently focused on user registration and needs expansion

### Blockers
1. **None currently**: No critical blockers at this stage

### Risks
1. **Database Schema Evolution**: As features are added, the database schema may need significant changes
2. **Performance Concerns**: Need to monitor query performance as data volume grows
3. **Security Considerations**: Authentication implementation will require careful security review

## Milestones and Targets

### Milestone 1: User Management (In Progress)
- ✅ User registration
- User authentication
- User profile management
- Follow functionality

**Target Completion**: TBD

### Milestone 2: Tweet Functionality
- Tweet creation
- Tweet retrieval
- Timeline implementation
- Tweet interactions (favorites, retweets)

**Target Completion**: TBD

### Milestone 3: Frontend Development
- User interface implementation
- Integration with backend API
- Responsive design
- User experience optimization

**Target Completion**: TBD

## Performance Metrics

### API Response Times
- Target: < 200ms for most operations
- Current: Not yet measured

### Test Coverage
- Target: > 80% code coverage
- Current: User registration functionality has good coverage

### Code Quality
- Using Biome for linting and formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Following established coding standards
