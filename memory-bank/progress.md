# Project Progress

## Current Status

The X-Echo project is in the early development phase, with the focus on establishing the foundation for the backend API. The project structure has been set up, and the database schema has been partially defined.

### Project Timeline
- **Project Start**: Initial setup and planning
- **Current Phase**: Backend API development - User management
- **Next Phase**: Authentication and user interactions
- **Future Phases**: Tweet functionality, social interactions, frontend development

## What Works

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ Docker setup for PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Prisma ORM configuration
- ✅ Basic Hono API server running

### Database
- ✅ User model defined in Prisma schema
- ✅ Prisma client setup for database access

### API
- ✅ Basic API server running on port 8080
- ✅ Hello world endpoint functioning

### Documentation
- ✅ Database architecture documentation
- ✅ User registration implementation plan
- ✅ Coding standards and patterns established

## What's In Progress

### User Management
- 🔄 User registration API implementation
- 🔄 Password hashing with bcrypt
- 🔄 Input validation with Zod

### Testing
- 🔄 Setting up testing infrastructure
- 🔄 Writing tests for user registration

## What's Left to Build

### Authentication
- ❌ User login functionality
- ❌ JWT token generation and validation
- ❌ Protected routes middleware
- ❌ Password reset functionality

### User Interactions
- ❌ User profile management
- ❌ Follow/unfollow functionality
- ❌ Follower/following lists

### Tweet Functionality
- ❌ Tweet creation
- ❌ Tweet retrieval (single and lists)
- ❌ Timeline functionality
- ❌ Tweet deletion

### Social Interactions
- ❌ Favorite/unfavorite functionality
- ❌ Retweet capabilities
- ❌ Reply functionality

### Frontend
- ❌ Frontend project setup
- ❌ User interface design
- ❌ Authentication flows
- ❌ Timeline and tweet display
- ❌ User profiles and interactions

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**: Need to implement a consistent error handling strategy across the API
2. **Validation**: Need to establish standardized validation patterns for all endpoints
3. **Testing**: Test coverage is currently minimal and needs expansion

### Blockers
1. **None currently**: No critical blockers at this stage

### Risks
1. **Database Schema Evolution**: As features are added, the database schema may need significant changes
2. **Performance Concerns**: Need to monitor query performance as data volume grows
3. **Security Considerations**: Authentication implementation will require careful security review
